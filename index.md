# About myself

## Here's a smaller heading

I am a Cloud Architect, leaving in Paris. Before joining Microsoft, I’ve been a developer and trainer for 7 years, mostly on Microsoft .NET, Web and cloud technologies.

I love to learn new things and share my experiments with other developers around the world, it could be by being a speaker in various conferences or on this blog. Before joining Microsoft I have been awarded as a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for almost 7 years.

I am currently part of the Commercial Software Engineering global team at Microsoft and my job is to help Microsoft’s top strategic customers to build and run cloud native applications on Microsoft Azure. My focuses are cloud architecture best practices, DevOps and Kubernetes.
